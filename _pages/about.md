Here is Shutter Zor / Xiangtai Zuo (左祥太).

This is my personal blog, which is a branch of [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I would like to share here the problems and solutions I have encountered in my own use of **Stata/Python**, and don't worry, they are free. Here are some addresses where I post videos/tweets, so feel free to subscribe and hopefully it will be helpful to you.

======
Limited by my technical level, I wasn't able to maximize the performance of this blog, so I only kept some basic features that I needed.
